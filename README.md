# Netflix Data Science Foundations Bootcamp: Midterm Project

Compares movie offerings from Netflix, Prime, Hulu, and Disney+ by rating, quantity, and release year.

## Analysis

We analyzed a dataset of movies offered by four popular streaming platforms. Each movie contained a title, release year, age (similar to the MPA film rating system), Rotten Tomatoes score, streaming platform, and type. After cleaning the data, we performed analyses to answer the following questions:
1. Which streaming platform offers recent movies?
2. Which streaming platform offers the highest number of movies?
3. Which streaming platform provides movies with better Rotten Tomatoes scores?

## Conclusion
Our analysis identified that Netflix is the streaming platform with the most recent movies. Amazon Prime offers the largest selection of movies compared to the other streaming platforms. Netflix has the highest number of movies rated "Fresh" on Rotten Tomatoes. These findings are valuable because they provide a deeper insight into the offerings of popular streaming platforms. While we cannot conclude which streaming platform is the best, prospective customers can determine which platform offers the best value based on their preferences. Those interested in new movies may see Netflix as the best pick, while others who care about the absolute quantity of movies may choose Amazon Prime. Overall, each streaming platform offers a unique selection of movies with their strengths and weaknesses.
